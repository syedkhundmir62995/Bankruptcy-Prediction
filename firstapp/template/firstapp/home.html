            <p class="data">
                Bankruptcy is the inability of a person or a business to pay their debts. It involves the sale of property and some other arrangement to pay as much as possible of the money a person or business entity owe.
                When a company declares bankruptcy, it’s a sign that it is no longer able to pay the debts as originally agreed and it can seriously damage the company’s credit history for more than 10 years.

            <p class="bankruptcy-info-data">Most individuals and business who file for bankruptcy have far more debts than money to
                 cover them and don’t see that changing anytime soon. In 2020, bankruptcy filers owed $86 billion and had assets of $56 billion. 
                 Most of those assets were real estate holdings, whose value is debatable. On the other hand, bankruptcy can often be used as a
                  financial planning tool when you do have enough money to repay debts, but need to restructure the terms.</p>
